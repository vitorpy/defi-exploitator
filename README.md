_The no code DeFi exploitator_

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5c0b3ca2-abc8-46aa-880c-9c4006608299/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/festive-snyder-a908d7/deploys)

Uses `react-flow-chart` to represent a Solidity call to be executed by a proxy
contract. Simulates (and executes) complex transactions, designed with flash
loan "hacks" in mind.

Associated contracts can be found in the TBD repository.

Building:

    yarn
    yarn parcel index.html

`master` branch is automatically deployed to Netlify.

How it works:

TBD

Dependencies (and credits):

- React, parcel, and Semantic UI React
- https://github.com/ajaxorg/treehugger
- https://github.com/MrBlenny/react-flow-chart
- https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react

To compensante my lack of experience with React a lot of code and structure was inspired by the uniswap-frontend project (https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-frontend). Any mistakes or style faults are however, obviously, my fault.
